h1. VALIDATIOUS-ON-RAILS ~ beta ~

_Rails plugin that maps model validations to class names on form elements to integrate with Validatious._

h2. What Is Validatious?

*Elevator pitch:* A (kick-ass) unobtrusive client-side validation javascript library - the only one you'll ever need.

"http://validatious.org":http://validatious.org

h2. Installation

*Gem:*

<pre>sudo gem install grimen-validatious-on-rails</pre>

and in @config/environment.rb@:

<pre>config.gem 'grimen-validatious-on-rails', :lib => 'validatious'</pre>

*Plugin:*

<pre>./script/plugin install git://github.com/grimen/validatious-on-rails.git</pre>

h2. Configuration

h3. 1. Generate required javascript files

<pre>
$ ./script/generate validatious                                                                                                                                                              
      create  public/javascripts/v2.standalone.full.min.js
      create  public/javascripts/validatious.config.js
</pre>

h3. 2. Include the javascripts in your layout

@app/views/application.html.erb@ or similar

<pre>
<head>
  ...
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'v2.standalone.full.min.js', 'validatious.config.js' %>
</head>
</pre>

*Note:* @validatious.config.js@ is optional, but contains some default Valdiatious-configuration that easily can be tweaked or extended - see "Validatious documentation":http://validatious.org/learn.

h2. Usage

*Easy!*

Consider you got some model validations:

<pre>
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :title
  validates_length_of :title, :within => 3..20
end
</pre>

...then you now got working client-side validations for any forms with class @validate@ (or any custom class - see documentation/config):

<pre>
<% form_for(@post, :html => {:class => 'validate'}) do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
<% end %>
</pre>

h2. Limitations

This is very much work-in-progress, so there are some known limitations that should work very soon. For example some validations are not supported yet - either because it takes some tricks, or it's not scalable without AJAX. See @TODO@.
