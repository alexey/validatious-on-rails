== TODO

=== validatious-on-rails

* Respect validation macro options:
  * :on => :<action> (i.e. if current form action is ACTION)
  * :if/:unless => true|false
  * :allow_blank - using "acceptEmpty"
* Add client-side support for all the standard Rails validations (that are possible)
  * validates_format_of
  * validates_exclusion_of
  * validates_inclusion_of
  * validates_uniqueness_of
* Generate Validatious-compatible localized error messages, either using I18n-js lib, or own solution.
* Support for custom Validatious-validators (v2.Validator) with adapter-interface
* Support more form helpers - also 3rd party ones (through adapters)?
* Test with form-builders also (now tests only use form helpers)

=== validatious

* Make the submit button be disabled (non-clickable) while the form contains invalid values
