== TODO

* Respect validation macro options:
  * :on => :<action> (i.e. if current form action is ACTION)
  * :if/:unless => true|false
  * :allow_blank - using "acceptEmpty"
* Add client-side support for all the standard Rails validations (that are possible)
  * validates_confirmation_of
  * validates_exclusion_of
  * validates_inclusion_of
  * validates_uniqueness_of
* Generate Validatious-compatible localized error messages, either using I18n-js lib, or own solution.
* Support for custom validators with adapter-interface
* Support more form helpers - also 3rd party ones (through adapters)?
* Full coverage tests
