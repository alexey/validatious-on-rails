== TODO

=== validatious-on-rails

* Respect validation macro options:
  * :on => :<action> (i.e. if current form action is ACTION)
  * :if/:unless => true|false (doubt this is even possible for all cases though - like Ruby procs)
  * :allow_blank - for all validations (implemented for format/inclusion/exclusion already)
* Add client-side support for all the standard Rails validations (that are possible)
  * validates_uniqueness_of (RemoteValidator)
  * validates_association (?)
* Fix I18n-message issues - I guess there are small bugs related to the I18n-lookup keys (easy to fix though).
* Finalize custom client-side Validatious-validators (v2.Validator) with adapter-interface
* Server-side (custom) Validatious-validator support (v2.Validator)
* Support 3rd party form helpers through adapters?
* If needed (becuase how ValidationReflection is implemented - a bit hardcoded): Own validation reflection.
* Clean up tests with Shoulda or similar - tighten up the tests, not full coverage now.

=== validatious

* Make the submit button be disabled (non-clickable) while the form contains invalid values (maybe)
