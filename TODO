== TODO

=== validatious-on-rails

* Make Rails core validations basic options fully supported (wait with :on and :if/:unless until later)
  * :allow_blank - for all validations (implemented for format/inclusion/exclusion already)
  * etc...
* Adapter-interface (API) for custom client-side Validatious-validators
* Additional helpers: Support 3rd party form helpers
* Initializer (generate with the generator)
* Respect the more advanced validation macro options - when possible:
  * :on => :<action> (i.e. if current form action is ACTION)
  * :if/:unless => true|false (doubt this is even possible for all cases though - like Ruby procs)
* Server-side (custom) Validatious-validator support (v2.Validator)
  * validates_uniqueness_of (RemoteValidator)
  * validates_association (?)
* Clean up tests with Shoulda or similar - tighten up the tests, not full coverage now.

=== validatious

* Make the submit button be disabled (non-clickable) while the form contains invalid values (maybe)
