== TODO

== High

* issue: Make messages not be bound to a specific validator, rather to a field. Tricky, but important.
* tests: make them pass again after all the new changes.
* validates_uniqueness_of/AJAX-bugs:
  * bug: Make it impossible to submit the form when this validation haven't passed

== Medium

* bug: if same validation is specified on same field, and it's ajax/remote - it'll trigger an infinite calling loop. Even though it's avoidable, it's bad.
* feature: Make any validation be validated remotely if requested, i.e. :ajax => true/false. Add "Remote"-prefix to affected classes. **
* feature: Validator API: Custom validators (client-side + remote)
* feature: Form Input Helper API: Custom form helpers (non-"core helper" based)
* doc: Documentation of the above

== Low

* feature: Make Rails core validations basic options fully supported **
  * :on => :create|:save|:update (not easy - RemoteValidator?)
  * :if/:unless => true|false (not easy - RemoteValidator?)
* test: Tighten up the tests more.

== Not sure

* feature: Consider filter/masking of invalid input (e.g. validates_numericality_of).
* feature: validates_association
