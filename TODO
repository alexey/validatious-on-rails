== TODO

=== validatious-on-rails

* Make Rails core validations basic options fully supported
  * :on => :<action> (i.e. if current form action is ACTION)
  * :if/:unless => true|false (doubt this is even possible for all cases though - like Ruby procs)
* Tighten up the tests more.
* Adapter-interface (API) for custom client-side Validatious-validators
* Additional helpers: Support 3rd party form helpers
* Initializer (generate with the generator) - most probably needed for making ValidationReflection to reflect on custom validations (defined upon project basis).
* Server-side (custom) Validatious-validator support (v2.Validator)
  * validates_uniqueness_of (RemoteValidator)
  * validates_association (?)

=== validatious

* Make the submit button be disabled (non-clickable) while the form contains invalid values (maybe)
