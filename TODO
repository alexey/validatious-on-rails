== TODO

== High

* issue: Make messages not be bound to a specific validator, rather to a field. Tricky, but important.
* bug: validates_uniqueness_of/AJAX: Don't flash a failure message on a field that is already validated as valid upon submit. Validatious-issue?

== Medium

* feature: Make any validation be validated remotely if requested, i.e. :ajax => true/false. Add "Remote"-prefix to affected classes. **
* feature: Finalize Custom Validator API
* doc: Documentation for Custom Validator API, and example in the initializer

== Low

* test: More thorough tests.

== Not sure

* feature: validates_association
